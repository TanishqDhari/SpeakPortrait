# 🗣️ SpeakPortrait

**SpeakPortrait** is an AI-driven tool that animates a static portrait image using a voice clip to produce a realistic talking-head video. It uses [SadTalker](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker) for head animation and can be extended with TTS or voice cloning models like OpenVoice.
